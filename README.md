# GooBook.io QL Server

This program uses Apollo Server with Express, along with GraphQL-Request and Apollo Client as GraphQL clients. The application is used to demonstrate queries, mutations, custom object types, authentication, and more.

I added authLinks and Apollo Client cache to this project. I also incorporated some Apollo Server mutations, Fetch Policies, Cache Manipulations and Fragments. I added Query Hooks for this code to cache network caches. And also added Mutation Hooks for this code. Apollo Client Autharitaions connect with QL. Client can get any informations about they want using this web page. Project released soon. 

N + 1 Query problems fixeded in this code and batching with DataLoader.
