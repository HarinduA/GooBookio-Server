# GooBook.io QL Server

This program uses Apollo Server with Express, along with GraphQL-Request and Apollo Client as GraphQL clients. The application is used to demonstrate queries, mutations, custom object types, authentication, and more.

 16/07/2024 = I added authLinks and Apollo Client cache to this project. I also incorporated some Apollo Server mutations, Fetch Policies, Cache Manipulations and Fragments.
