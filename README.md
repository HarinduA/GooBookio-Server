* Fragments: Used GraphQL fragments to optimize query efficiency.
* Query Hooks: Added hooks for managing query data and caching network responses.
* Mutation Hooks: Integrated hooks for handling mutations with improved performance.
* DataLoader Integration: Resolved N + 1 query problems by incorporating DataLoader for batching and caching.
* Install DataLoader using npm install dataloader.
